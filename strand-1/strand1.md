# Dorm Room Design Project - Criterion A
## Strand 1 - Filippo Fonseca
_What makes a perfect design? How can we optimize the spaces, areas, and environments we as individuals use to work, relax, and reside in for maximum efficiency and productive output in times of work and a clear contract with relaxation and rest in others, **all in the same space?**_. These are both questions that have strained the minds of new-bound college students, interior designers, and productivity enthusiasts for as long as college dormitories (dorms) have existed. It doesn't always have to be this way, however, as when elements that are essential to a dorm room (and any students' college career, for that matter), like time management, proper positioning, spacial awareness, mental wellbeing, and others, amazing results are achievable. The key to achieving them, however, is not as simple. As mentioned earlier, not only must one always entertain a living and working environment that is "well designed" and "aesthetically pleasing", but instead also account for perhaps even more important and necessary factors to complement the college experience of a certain individual, such as work-life balance, productive output, efficiency, and rest. By taking these into account with purposeful and intentional meaning when designing one's college dorm room, not only do we allow for success in the four previously mentioned areas (balance, productive output, efficiency, and rest), but we also empower ourselves to create a space that is both aesthetically pleasing and makes us happy (a key to mental health & wellbeing, an integral element in college and in life) at the same time.
